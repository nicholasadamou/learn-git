## Switch a branch
```sh
git checkout branch_name
```
This command switches to the `branch_name` branch. It changes the working directory to the branch specified. The changes in the working directory are based on the branch you switch to. The `branch_name` is the name of the branch you want to switch to.

#### Example: Switch to the `main` branch
```sh
git checkout main
```
