## Switch a branch
```sh
git checkout branch_name
```
This command switches to the `branch_name` branch. It changes the working directory to the branch specified. The changes in the working directory are based on the branch you switch to. The `branch_name` is the name of the branch you want to switch to.

#### Example: Switch to the `main` branch
```sh
git checkout main
```

	You can also use the shorthand `git switch branch_name` to switch branches. You can learn more about the `git switch` command in the [Git Switch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch) documentation.
