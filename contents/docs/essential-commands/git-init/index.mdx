#### Initialize a Git repository
Initializes a new Git repository. This command creates a
new Git repository in the current directory. It sets up the
basic files and directories needed to start tracking changes


Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder:

```sh
git init
```
**Note:** Git now knows that it should watch the folder you initiated it on. Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes.

You just created your first Git repository!
